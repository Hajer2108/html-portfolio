<h1>Hajer's top three favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>Romance genre</h2> 
<hr /> 
<h3>The Note Book</h3> 
<h3>Titanic</h3> 
<h3>I will always love you</h3>

<p>Above are my three favourite movies, that I can happily watch over and over again. 
 I'm a sucker for romance, so whenever I need a reminder of how lonely I am I just watch these
 movies and begin to sobe. So if you're a sucker for romance, give them a watch, and thank me
 later.</p>
