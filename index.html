        <h2>Movie Rank Project</h2>
        <h3>Take a closer look<a href="Public/MovieRank.html">here!</a></h3>
        <p>This is the very first project I attempted using HTML elements, as shown in the preview, I have used
            the h1, h2, and h3 element to create my heading and subheadings, I also experimented using the 
            horizontal element, (which I find quite cool!)
        </p>

        <h2>Birthday Invite Project</h2>
        <h3>Take a closer look<a href="Public/BirthdayInvite.html">here!</a></h3>
        <p>In this project, I experimented using photo placeholders from Lorem Picsum to create an image elment,
             I also played around with creating a list, and embedding my very firs anchor element into a paragaph. 
            Take a look!</p>
