This is a code repository of the very first projects I created using HTML, its a collection of two projects. The first project is a list of my favourite movies, in order of rank and my second project is a Birthday Invitation. It was my first time experimenting with different HTML elements. (If you click the links "here!"it will direct you to the orignal website, where you can have a closer look). 

This project is completed and was achieved using the following tech stack: HTML 

The link to the live project is hosted on Netlify:
